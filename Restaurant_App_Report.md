## Database Design and Implementation

### Entity Relationship Structure

The application database consists of four primary entities with well-defined relationships:

**CUSTOMERS Entity**:
- Stores customer demographic and contact information
- Implements unique constraints on phone numbers and email addresses
- Maintains creation and update timestamps for audit purposes

**TABLES Entity**:
- Defines restaurant table configuration including capacity and location
- Implements status management for availability, reservation, and maintenance states
- Enforces positive capacity constraints through database-level checks

**RESERVATIONS Entity**:
- Central entity linking customers to table assignments
- Implements temporal constraints preventing double-booking scenarios
- Maintains reservation status workflow (pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled)

**USERS Entity**:
- Administrative user management with role-based permissions
- Secure password storage using bcrypt hashing algorithms
- Session tracking for security and audit purposes

### Database Optimization Features

**Indexing Strategy**:
- Primary key optimization for all entities
- Composite indexes on frequently queried columns (dates, status, customer information)
- Foreign key indexing for efficient join operations

**Constraint Implementation**:
- Referential integrity through foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints preventing duplicate customer contacts
- Check constraints ensuring data validity (positive capacities, valid party sizes)
- Temporal constraints preventing overlapping table reservations
