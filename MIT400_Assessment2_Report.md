## 2. Database Design and Implementation

### 2.1 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The database schema implements four core entities with well-defined relationships:

```
CUSTOMERS ||--o{ RESERVATIONS
TABLES ||--o{ RESERVATIONS  
USERS ||--o{ ADMINISTRATIVE_ACTIONS
```

**Core Entities:**
- **Customers**: Customer demographic and contact information
- **Tables**: Restaurant table configuration and capacity
- **Reservations**: Booking details and status management
- **Users**: Administrative and staff access control

### 2.2 Database Schema Implementation

#### Table Structures:

**CUSTOMERS Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);
```

**TABLES Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE tables (
    table_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    table_number INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    capacity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('available','reserved','maintenance'),
    location VARCHAR(100),
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME,
    CONSTRAINT check_capacity_positive CHECK (capacity > 0)
);
```

**RESERVATIONS Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    reservation_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    table_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    reservation_date DATE NOT NULL,
    reservation_time TIME NOT NULL,
    party_size INTEGER NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('pending','confirmed','cancelled','completed'),
    special_requests TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME,
    CONSTRAINT check_party_size_positive CHECK (party_size > 0),
    CONSTRAINT unique_table_datetime UNIQUE (table_id, reservation_date, reservation_time),
    FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY(table_id) REFERENCES tables (table_id)
);
```

**USERS Table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin','staff','customer'),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    created_at DATETIME,
    last_login DATETIME
);
```
